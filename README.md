# common-voice-da-sentence-inspiration
Project to help create inspiration for creating new sentences to use in common voice - by finding words in the dictionary not yet used in any sentences in Common Voice. 

To improve the quality of the material available for speaking, sentences should be modern and include many different words. By creating sentences we ensure the material is modern / in use Danish, and by using different words not yet introduced to the dataset, we expand the width of the dataset. Furthermore, getting words prompts can be a big help to spark inspiration to introduce new sentences.
